//! Crate to mock [`slog`] macros.
//!
//! This exports many expected macros from the `slog` crate,
//! but has them compile into no-ops.
//!
//! The goal is to allow a crate consumer to have a feature where
//! this crate is used instead of `slog`, and all logging calls
//! resolve cleanly but don't produce any code in the final binary.
//!
//! Not all of `slog`'s functionality is mocked: you will need to
//! gate any actual requirements on its traits or structures
//! behind `#[cfg(feature)]` checks.
